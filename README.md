# PIC-and-AVR-LTE-Demo-Files

This repository contains the .hex files that you can use to program your Microchipo AVR or PIC boards with to demo cellular function using the Ublox SARA-R4 LTE CAT-M1 click board.

Below you will see a short description of each .hex file and which board it can be used with.

This is revision 1.00 of the applications and documentation.

## Individual .hex Files and their Associated Boards

**AVR-BLE_LTE_Click.hex** \|  [AVR-BLE](https://www.futureelectronics.com/p/development-tools--microcontroller-microprocessor--8-bit-eval-board/dt100111-microchip-5123703)

Demo Features: This application will provide a wired UART pass through that will allow you to control the cellular module via AT commands. Addtionally, there is a small API to send commands to the cellular module over the UART which you can use to develop your own application.

**AVR-IoT_LTE_Click.hex** \| [AVR-IoT](https://www.futureelectronics.com/p/development-tools--rf-wireless/ev15r70a-microchip-8125363)

Demo Features: This application will provide a wired UART pass through that will allow you to control the cellular module via AT commands. Addtionally, there is a small API to send commands to the cellular module over the UART which you can use to develop your own application.

**FCS-LTE_AVR_LIGHTBLUE_EXPLORER_DEMO.hex** \| [AVR-BLE](https://www.futureelectronics.com/p/development-tools--microcontroller-microprocessor--8-bit-eval-board/dt100111-microchip-5123703)

Demo Features: This application is based on Microchip's existing LightBlue Explorer demo. Via BLE, you can control LEDs, see temperature, and accelrometer data. Additionally, with using the ASCII or Hex text box on the LightBlue app you can communicate with the cellular module over BLE by issuing it AT commands.

**FCS-LTE_PIC_LIGHTBLUE_EXPLORER_DEMO.hex** \| [PIC-BLE](https://www.futureelectronics.com/p/development-tools--microcontroller-microprocessor--8-bit-eval-board/dt100112-microchip-6123703)

Demo Features: This application is based on Microchip's existing LightBlue Explorer demo. Via BLE, you can control LEDs, see temperature, and accelrometer data. Additionally, with using the ASCII or Hex text box on the LightBlue app you can communicate with the cellular module over BLE by issuing it AT commands.
